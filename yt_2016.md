# Candidates Generations

## Target

* training as multi-class-classification problem (which video will be watched - class will br > 1M) - will be a problem

## Features 

video-watch sequence - apply word2vec
search - apply word2vec
static profile (user)

auto-feature engineering by DNN

* Simple Dense Layer x 3 with relu - [check this](https://github.com/hyez/Deep-Youtube-Recommendations/blob/master/model/candidate_generation.py#L27-L30)

## Serving 

apply ANN

# Ranking

## Features
