1. experiement tracking(By a tracking dashboard services using git)
   1. not easy to log custom metrics (keras model with F1 score and sentence prediction)
   2. still need to figure out how to build your own tracking server.
2. data versioning

can we do data versioning in pixlake?

daily stuff - yes

how about fix dataset?

v1/v2/v3 and check the difference?
