# Key
* background and foreground training process with obj/no obj really suffer by hilghy imblanced classfication problem
* to solve that, use focal loss
* They also called the network **RetinaNet**

# Paper
* [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection, 3426+](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Lin_Focal_Loss_for_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)

# implementation
* [tf - been tested, 15+ star](https://github.com/artemmavrin/focal-loss)
* [tf, Keras only 3lines of code 255+ stars](https://github.com/mkocabas/focal-loss-keras/blob/master/focal_loss.py)
