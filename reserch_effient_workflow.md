# Still continously updating process

## From liu

1. background research - the hypothesis, the mathmatical analysis, the result
2. your new idea
3. describe your idea using figure / math equation
4. what result you expect if put your idea in.
5. define what data you want to collect, very detailly.
6. plot your hypothetical figure(including x axis, y axis, color legend)
7. start your coding job to collect data / run simulation

Benifits : 

1. avoid random experiments(no any new result to improve your hypothesis) - save a lot of time!
2. make sure you know what are you doing
