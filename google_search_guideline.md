* user location
* search engine result page(SERP)
  * result
    * result block - which display information of items

1. Dominant interpretation - `most user mean` when they type the query - `use keyword impressions as proxy`
   1. in guideline - the dominant interpretation should be clear to you(labeller), especially after the labeller doing a little web research.
2. common interpretation -   `many or some user mean` 
   1. a query can have multiple common interpretation
3. minor interpretation - `few users have in mind`
